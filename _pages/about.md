Wen-Dong Jiang (graduate student member, IEEE) received his B.S. degree from the Department of Multimedia and Game Science Development, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2021. He earned his M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Ming Chuan University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2023. Since 2022, he has been pursuing a B.S. degree in Software Engineering at Fayette Institute of Technology, USA, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering at Tamkang University. Dr. Jiang's research interests include explainable machine learning and its applications in smart cities.
